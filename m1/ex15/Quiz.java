	Description:
	Write an application that contains an array of 10 multiple-choice quiz 
	questions related to your favorite hobby. Each question contains three 
	answer choices. Also create an array that holds the correct answer to each
	question -- A, B, or C. Display each question and verify that the user 
	enters only A, B, or C as the answer -- if not, keep prompting the user 
	until a valid response is entered. If the user responds to a question 
	correctly, display "Correct!"; otherwise, display "The correct answer is" 
	and the letter of the correct answer. After the user answers all the 
	questions, display the number of correct and incorrect answers. Save the 
	file as Quiz.java
