 * Assignment: 			Ch 11 Ex 8
 * 
 * Description:			Write an application named UseInsurance that uses
 * an abstract Insurance class and Health and Life subclasses to display
 * different types of insurance policies and the cost per month. The 
 * Insurance class contains a String representing the type of insurance
 * and a double that holds the monthly price. The Insurance class 
 * constructor requires a String argument indicating the type of 
 * insurance, but the Life and Health class constructors require no 
 * arguments. The Insurance class contains a get method for each field;
 * it also contains two abstract methods named setCost() and display().
 * The Life class setCost() method sets the monthly fee to $36, and the 
 * Health class sets the monthly fee to $196. Write an application named
 * UseInsurance that prompts the user for the type of insurance to be 
 * displayed, and then create the appropriate object. Save the files as
 * Life.java, Health.java, Insurance.java, and UseInsurance.java.
